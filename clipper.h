#define MAX_CLIP 64

// This is a general purpose CohenSutherland polygon clipper written in
// C++ and using STL.  This clipper is not inherently slow, but then again
// it is not necessarily blazingly fast.  It uses STL vectors to build
// the clipped polygon and return the result.
//
// This routine is presented to educate clearly the cohen sutherland
// clipping algorithm.  It clips against an arbitrary
// 3d axis aligned bounding region which you specify.
//
// It is fairly straightforward to change the Vector3d class to some
// other vertex format and easily use this routine to clip any kind
// of vertex data with any number of interpolants.
//
// This was written by John W. Ratcliff (jratcliff@verant.com) on
// August 10, 2000 and is relased into the public domain as part of
// the Code Snippet library on FlipCode.com
